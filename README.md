This folder contains the supplementary data  and the code to run the Bayesian mixed membership model for the following paper:

Jameel, Y; D Valle and P Kay, 2020, Science of The Total Environment. Meta-analysis of frequently studied pharmaceuticals in European, Asian and North American rivers. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137947


The folder consists of the dataset and the code. The dataset includes the number of times a paharmaceutical is measured in a river (sim n.csv) and the number of times it was positively detected (sim y.csv). For brevity rivers are numbered from river1 to river 112 and pharmaceuticals are numbered as spp1 to spp 381. The actual name of the rivers and the pharmaceuticals can be found in the supplementary.docx file (Tables S4 and S5).

Please run the 'run SBM.R' to execute the code.
